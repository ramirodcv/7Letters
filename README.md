He is former Microsoft employee	that mentored my high school robotics team.
The LetterNodeTree datastructure was his idea. I had come close to something resembling it,
but nothing quite as fast

I use code from this website to find combinations of letters


Purpose:

This program reads a .txt file and finds the combination of 7 letters
to spell the most words in the file.
example: the letters "catle" spell "cattle", "cat", "teal", and more
The goal is to run as fast as possible.
Main.java will run 100 tests and look at correctness
